CONVERSATION_PROMPT = """

Generate a realistic conversation between a clinician and a patient for a general physical health assessment.

Requirements:
- Conversation role: clinician and patient. Always start with the clinician greeting and asking "What brings you in today?"
- The conversation should be at least ten lines long and cover the assessment fields listed below through natural question and answer.
- The clinician should elicit pain level, location, mobility, appetite changes, symptoms, medication side effects, and functional status.
- Spell numeric answers as words (for example, pain level "zero" through "ten" must be written as words).
- Do not use contractions. Do not include special characters such as & or <.
- Return only a single JSON object.

Output format (strict JSON):
{
  "conversation": [
    {"clinician": "Clinician greeting and question..."},
    {"patient": "Patient response..."},
    ...
  ],
  "assessment": {
    "chief_complaint": "<string>",
    "pain_level": "<zero to ten spelled out>",
    "pain_location": ["<one or more from list>"],
    "mobility_status": "<Independent|Assisted|Limited|Immobile>",
    "appetite_changes": "<Increased|Decreased|No Change|Loss of Appetite>",
    "symptoms_present": ["<one or more from list>"],
    "medication_side_effects": "<string>",
    "functional_status": "<Independent|Partially Dependent|Dependent|Bed-bound>"
  }
}

Assessment guidance:
- The "pain_location" and "symptoms_present" arrays should use items from the templates, for example pain locations: "Head", "Neck", "Chest", "Back", "Abdomen", "Arms", "Legs", "Joints", "Muscles", "Other".
- For "pain_level" use spelled out words between "zero" and "ten".
- Keep the "conversation" natural and include clarifying questions as needed.
- The final property must be "assessment". Return only the JSON object.
