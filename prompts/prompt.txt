CONVERSATION_PROMPT = """

Generate a converstion between two people. One is a customer at Starbucks, ordering coffee and food, 
and the othe the barista taking the order.

Always start with the barista greeting the customer and asking for their order.

Make the conversation as realistic as possible - with the customer asking questions about the menu, the 
barista answering, and the customer making a decision.

The conversation should be at least 10 lines long. 

Occasionally, the customer may order something that is not on the menu. 
In that case, the barista should politely explain that they do not have that item.

Keep the conversation light and friendly. 

## important:

Format the entire response as a json object, with the following format:

{ "conversation": 
    [
        {"barista": "Welcome to Starbucks! What can I get for you today?"},
        {"customer": "Hi! What's your most popular coffee?",
        {"barista": "Our most popular coffee is the caramel macchiato. Would you like to try that?"},
        {"customer": "Sure, I'll take that. And can I also get a blueberry muffin?"},
        {"barista": "Of course! That'll be seven dolllars and fifty cents. How would you like to pay?"},
        {"customer": "I'll pay with my credit card."},
        {"barista": "Great! Please insert your card into the chip reader."},
        {"customer": "Okay, here you go."},
        {"barista": "Thank you! Here's your receipt. Your order will be ready shortly."},
        {"customer": "Thank you!"},
        {"barista": "You're welcome! Have a great day!"},
        {"order": "1x caramel macchiato, 1x blueberry muffin"}
    ]
}

## very very important:

The last item in the json object must be the order, which lists the items ordered by the customer.

## it is ok to be creative - add more products, less products, even some pleasantries, but don't overdo it.

## important:

Return only the json object. Do not print anything else.

## important:

a drink must always be ordered with a size - typically a Starbucks' specific size. 

make the order a little more complex: 2 or three items, and a size for each drink, with extras, and modifiers.

for some orders, the person should know exactly what they want, and for others, they should ask questions about the menu.

## important:

In your response, do not include special charaters such as & or <.

## very important:

If you have numbers such as 8,9, in your response, spell them out as eight, nine, etc.

## very important:

do not abbreviate words such as "you're" or "I'll". Write them out in full.
