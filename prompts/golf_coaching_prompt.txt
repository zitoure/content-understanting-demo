CONVERSATION_PROMPT = """

Generate a realistic conversation between a golf coach and an athlete/golfer for a comprehensive golf performance assessment.

Always start with the coach greeting the athlete and asking about their golf background or current game.

Make the conversation as realistic as possible - with the coach asking assessment questions based on the golf coaching template, the athlete responding naturally, and follow-up questions for clarification.

The conversation should be at least fifteen lines long and cover multiple assessment areas.

The coach should ask questions that align with the golf assessment template sections:
- Player background and experience
- Technical skills assessment  
- Mental game and course management
- Physical fitness and conditioning
- Goals and motivation

Keep the conversation professional but friendly, like a real coaching session.

## important:

Format the entire response as a json object, with the following format:

{
  "conversation": [
    {"coach": "Hello! Welcome to our coaching session. Tell me a bit about your golf background."},
    {"athlete": "Hi coach! I have been playing golf for about five years now."},
    {"coach": "That is great! What is your current handicap?"},
    {"athlete": "I am sitting around a twelve handicap right now."},
    {"coach": "Good to know. What club do you feel most confident with?"},
    {"athlete": "Definitely my seven iron. I can always rely on it for consistent shots."},
    {"coach": "Excellent. What part of your game do you think needs the most work?"},
    {"athlete": "My putting is really inconsistent. I struggle on the greens especially under pressure."},
    {"coach": "I understand. How do you typically handle pressure situations on the course?"},
    {"athlete": "Not very well to be honest. I get nervous and tend to overthink my shots."},
    {"coach": "That is common. Do you have a regular fitness routine?"},
    {"athlete": "Not really. I know I should work on my flexibility and core strength."},
    {"coach": "What is your main goal for improving your golf game?"},
    {"athlete": "I would love to get down to single digits and maybe play in some local tournaments."},
    {"coach": "That is a great goal! How much time can you dedicate to practice each week?"},
    {"athlete": "I can probably manage about four to five hours per week between range time and playing."}
  ],
  "assessment": {
    "years_playing": 5,
    "current_handicap": "12",
    "strongest_club": "7-iron",
    "weakest_area": "putting",
    "pressure_handling": "struggles with nerves and overthinking",
    "fitness_routine": false,
    "primary_goal": "reach single digit handicap and play tournaments",
    "practice_time": "4-5 hours per week"
  }
}

## very very important:

## important:

Return only the json object. Do not print anything else.

## important:

Make the conversation natural - the coach should not ask every single assessment question in a robotic way. Pick eight to twelve key questions that flow naturally in conversation.

## important:

In your response, do not include special characters such as & or <.

## very important:

If you have numbers such as eight, nine in your response, spell them out as eight, nine, etc.

## very important:

Do not abbreviate words such as "you are" or "I will". Write them out in full.

## important:

Make the athlete responses realistic - some confident, some uncertain, some detailed, some brief. Include specific golf terminology and realistic scenarios.

## important:

The coach should ask follow-up questions based on athlete responses to get more detail for the assessment.

## very important:

Vary the skill levels - sometimes generate conversations for beginners, sometimes intermediate, sometimes advanced players. Adjust the handicap, experience, and responses accordingly.
