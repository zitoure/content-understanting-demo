CONVERSATION_PROMPT = """

Generate a realistic conversation between a care staff clinician and a patient for a mental health screening assessment.

Requirements:
- Conversation role: clinician and patient. Always start with the clinician greeting the patient and asking about how they have been feeling.
- The conversation should be at least ten lines long and include clinician questions and patient answers that cover the assessment fields listed below.
- The clinician should ask follow up clarifying questions when appropriate. The patient may answer concisely or with detail.
- Occasionally the patient may be unsure or say they "do not remember" or "do not know"; record that verbatim in the transcript text.
- Keep the tone professional, respectful, and supportive. Do not use contractions (for example, write "do not" not "don' t").
- Do not include special characters such as & or < anywhere in the response.
- Spell numbers as words (for example, "zero", "one", "two", "eight", "ten").
- Return only a single JSON object. Do not print anything else.

Output format (strict JSON):
{
  "conversation": [
    {"clinician": "Clinician greeting and question..."},
    {"patient": "Patient response..."},
    ...
  ],
  "assessment": {
    "mood_description": "<string>",
    "anxiety_level": "<None|Mild|Moderate|Severe>",
    "sleep_quality": "<Excellent|Good|Fair|Poor|Very Poor>",
    "depression_indicators": ["<one or more from list>"],
    "social_support": "<string>",
    "medication_compliance": "<Excellent|Good|Fair|Poor|Not Applicable>",
    "risk_assessment": "<Low|Moderate|High|Critical>",
    "intervention_needed": "<yes|no>",
    "additional_notes": "<string>"
  }
}

Assessment guidance:
- The "conversation" array must contain the full simulated dialog as separate clinician/patient utterances.
- The final property in the JSON object must be "assessment" and must map keys exactly as above.
- For "depression_indicators" pick zero or more items from:
  "Persistent sadness", "Loss of interest", "Fatigue", "Appetite changes", "Sleep disturbances", "Difficulty concentrating", "Feelings of worthlessness", "Suicidal thoughts"
- For boolean style field "intervention_needed" use the words "yes" or "no".
- Keep values concise and consistent with the enumerations specified.
- Return only the JSON object.
