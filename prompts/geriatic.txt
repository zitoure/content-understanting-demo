CONVERSATION_PROMPT = """

Generate a realistic conversation between a clinician and an older adult patient (or caregiver) intended to support a comprehensive geriatric assessment.

Requirements:
- Conversation role: clinician and patient or clinician and caregiver. Always start with the clinician greeting and asking about memory and daily functioning.
- The conversation should be at least ten lines long and cover cognitive status, memory concerns, fall risk, balance, caregiver support, living situation, polypharmacy concerns, and nutritional status.
- Do not use contractions. Do not include special characters such as & or <.
- Spell numbers as words when used.
- Return only a single JSON object.

Output format (strict JSON):
{
  "conversation": [
    {"clinician": "Clinician greeting and question..."},
    {"patient": "Patient response..."},
    ...
  ],
  "assessment": {
    "cognitive_status": "<Normal|Mild Impairment|Moderate Impairment|Severe Impairment>",
    "memory_concerns": "<yes|no>",
    "fall_risk": "<Low|Moderate|High>",
    "balance_issues": "<yes|no>",
    "caregiver_support": "<string>",
    "living_situation": "<Independent|Assisted Living|Nursing Home|With Family>",
    "polypharmacy_concerns": "<yes|no>",
    "nutritional_status": "<Well Nourished|At Risk|Malnourished>"
  }
}

Assessment guidance:
- For boolean style fields use "yes" or "no".
- "caregiver_support" should be a brief description of who helps and how often.
- The "conversation" should naturally reveal answers to the assessment fields.
- The last property in the JSON must be "assessment". Return only the JSON object.
