    {"patient": "I have been experiencing some pain in my lower back."},
    {"clinician": "I am sorry to hear that. On a scale from zero to ten, how would you rate your pain?"}, 
    {"patient": "I would say it is about a six."}, 
    {"clinician": "Thank you for that information. Can you tell me more about the location of the pain? Is it concentrated in one area or does it radiate?"}, 
    {"patient": "It is mostly in the lower back, but sometimes it radiates down my legs."}, 
    {"clinician": "I see. Have you noticed any changes in your mobility because of this pain?"}, 
    {"patient": "Yes, I feel somewhat limited. I can walk, but it is difficult."}, 
    {"clinician": "Understood. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite recently?"}, 
    {"patient": "Actually, I have had a decreased appetite. I just do not feel like eating much."}, 
    {"clinician": "Thank you for sharing that. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing?"}, 
    {"patient": "I have also been feeling fatigued and occasionally have headaches."}, 
    {"clinician": "I appreciate you letting me know. Are you currently taking any medications, and if so, have you experienced any side effects from them?"}, 
    {"patient": "Yes, I take a pain medication, but it makes me feel a bit dizzy sometimes."}, 
    {"clinician": "Thank you for your honesty. Lastly, how would you describe your overall functional status? Are you able to manage daily activities independently?"}, 
    {"patient": "I am partially dependent. I need help with some tasks, but I can manage a few things on my own."}
