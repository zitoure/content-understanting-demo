    {"clinician": "Good morning. It is nice to see you today. How have you been feeling regarding your memory and daily functioning lately?"},
    {"patient": "Good morning. I think my memory has been a bit off. I sometimes forget where I put things or what I was about to do."},
    {"clinician": "I see. It is not uncommon for memory to change as we age. Have you noticed any other specific memory concerns or difficulties in your daily activities?"}, 
    {"patient": "Yes, I also struggle to remember appointments or when to take my medications."},
    {"clinician": "That is important to note. It sounds like there might be some challenges. How do you manage your medications? Are you taking many?"}, 
    {"patient": "I take a few pills each day, but I sometimes forget if I took them or not."}, 
    {"clinician": "That could be a concern, especially with polypharmacy. We may need to review your medications. Have you experienced any falls or near-falls recently?"}, 
    {"patient": "I have not fallen, but I do feel a bit unsteady at times, especially when I get out of bed too quickly."}, 
    {"clinician": "It is good that you have not had any falls, but it sounds like there may be a moderate risk. Who helps you around the house?"}, 
    {"patient": "My daughter comes by a few times a week to help me with chores and to make sure I am eating well."},
    {"clinician": "That is great to hear. It sounds like you have some caregiver support. How do you feel about your living situation? Is it comfortable for you?"}, 
    {"patient": "I live alone, and I am comfortable here, but I do worry about managing everything."}, 
    {"clinician": "Understood. We may want to assess your nutritional status as well. Are you eating regular meals?"}, 
    {"patient": "I try, but sometimes I skip meals if I do not feel like cooking."}
