    {"patient": "Hello. I have been feeling quite anxious, to be honest."},
    {"clinician": "I appreciate you sharing that. Can you describe what has been causing your anxiety?"}, 
    {"patient": "I am not sure. It just feels like there is a lot of pressure at work and in my personal life."}, 
    {"clinician": "That sounds challenging. On a scale of zero to ten, how would you rate your anxiety level?"}, 
    {"patient": "I would say it is about a seven."}, 
    {"clinician": "Thank you for that information. How about your mood? Have you experienced any persistent sadness or loss of interest in activities?"},

    {"clinician": "I see. How has your sleep been? Do you feel rested when you wake up?"}, 
    {"patient": "My sleep is fair. I often wake up in the middle of the night."}, 
    {"clinician": "That can be tough. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels?"}, 
    {"patient": "I do not remember my appetite changing, but I feel very tired all the time."}, 
    {"clinician": "Thank you for sharing that. How do you feel about the support you have from family and friends?"}, 
    {"patient": "I have some support, but sometimes I feel alone."}, 
    {"clinician": "I appreciate your honesty. Have you been consistent with any medications you might be taking?"}, 
    {"patient": "I take my medication regularly."}, 
    {"clinician": "That is good to hear. Based on what you have shared, do you feel you are at risk of harming yourself or others?"}, 
    {"patient": "No, I do not feel that way."}, 
    {"clinician": "Thank you for clarifying that. Do you think you may need any additional support or intervention at this time?"}, 
    {"patient": "Yes, I think I could benefit from more help."}
